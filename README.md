# Simple Webpage

# Web Page Design: 

The web page has been built using Bootstrap 5, and I have integrated Google Fonts as specified. For the mobile view, I applied my creativity to ensure responsiveness while maintaining the design's integrity.

# Mobile View: 

Since the Figma file did not include a mobile layout, I designed the mobile version to ensure a smooth user experience across various screen sizes.

# Technologies Used:

HTML5

CSS3

Bootstrap 5
